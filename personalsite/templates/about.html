  <p>
    As much as I would like to claim that the picture on the left is of me, I
    cannot. This is my dog Rilee, and she helps to keep me somewhat sane during
    pretty much anything.

  <p>
    There's not much to say about me other than what can be found around, on my
    <a href="/blog">Blog</a>,
    <a href="https://www.github.com/pyxxil">GitHub</a>/
    <a href="https://www.gitlab.com/pyxxil">Gitlab</a>, or
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/josh-hill-b655131a1/">LinkedIn</a>. I'm
    just someone who enjoys solving problems, and programming just so happens to
    be the tool with which I do so.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm currently employed as a Junior Software Developer, working on Robotic
    Process Automation, Business Process Automation, and bits of other stuff
    here and there such as deployment of processes, working on API's, etc.
  </p>

  <p>
    Generally, I haven't ever stuck to one singular passion within programming.
    I'll often swap around what I like to do, which may have lead me down to
    almost being a "Jack of All Trades, Master of None", however I like to think
    most of the stuff I have done has all lead to making me a better developer
    in some way. I've spent the past few years working on several personal
    projects, a few of which you can find amongst my
    <a href="/projects">Projects</a> page on this website.
