      As much as I would like to claim that the picture on the left is of me, I
      cannot. This is my dog Rilee, and she helps to keep me somewhat sane during
      pretty much anything.

      There's not much to say about me other than what can be found around, on my
      <a href="/blog">Blog</a>,
      <a href="https://www.github.com/pyxxil">GitHub</a>/
      <a href="https://www.gitlab.com/pyxxil">Gitlab</a>, or
      <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pyxxil">LinkedIn</a>. I'm
      just someone who enjoys solving problems, and programming just so happens to
      be the tool with which I do so.

      Generally, I haven't ever stuck to one singular passion within programming.
      I'll often swap around what I like to do, which may have lead me down to
      almost being a "Jack of All Trades, Master of None", however I like to think
      most of the stuff I have done has all lead to making me a better developer
      in some way. I've spent the past few years working on several personal
      projects, a few of which you can find amongst my
      <a href="/projects">Projects</a> page on this website.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm currently employed as a Junior Software Developer, working on Robotic
      Process Automation, Business Process Automation, and bits and bobs of several
      other things. The tech stack involved is ever changing, but it mostly revolves
      around the following:
      <ul>
        <li class="about-item">Java</li>
        <li class="about-item">Groovy</li>
        <li class="about-item">Python</li>
        <li class="about-item">JavaScript/TypeScript</li>
        <li class="about-item">Angular</li>
        <li class="about-item">BonitaSoft</li>
        <li class="about-item">UiPath</li>
        <li class="about-item">Bash</li>
        <li class="about-item">git</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      In my own time, with the aforementioned projects, I've built up some skill with
      the following technologies (excluding the above):
      <ul>
        <li class="about-item">C</li>
        <li class="about-item">C++</li>
        <li class="about-item">C#</li>
        <li class="about-item">Debugging (gdb, lldb, rubber duck, print)</li>
        <li class="about-item">HTML/CSS</li>
        <li class="about-item">Linux</li>
        <li class="about-item">React</li>
        <li class="about-item">Rust</li>
        <li class="about-item">Valgrind</li>
      </ul>
