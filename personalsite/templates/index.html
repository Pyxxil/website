    <h2>Welcome to my website!</h1>

    <p>
      This website exists for several reasons, all of which I will lay out below. I hope you enjoy your stay!

<main class="content-grid">
  <div class="content shadow rounded">
    <h3 class="centered">To learn about Web Development</h3>

    <p>
      While web development has never been my forte, nor something I'm particularly interested in doing,
      it has its purpose. While this website offers me many opportunities that I find a lot more pressing,
      it would be a mistake to not actually enjoy the process, nor actually try my best to actually do it well.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="content shadow rounded">
    <h3 class="centered">To host some of my projects</h3>

    <p>
      This has become a lot more relevant to me now that I've spent a lot of time writing Typescript, and
      dabbling a little with Web Assembly (via Rust and wasm-bindgen).
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="content shadow rounded">
    <h3 class="centered">A place I could put some writings</h3>

    <p>
      This might not be as important to anyone else as it is to me, but writing has always been my way of
      getting things off my mind and helping me explain things I've been thinking about.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="content shadow rounded">
    <h3 class="centered">To show off</h3>

    <p>
      One of the more semi-important reasons for making this website. I'm affored the opportunity to
      present a lot of my projects in a nicer way than with a GitHub/GitLab repository. That is to say
      that it allows me to provide my own flair and touch to the way they are presented, and hopefully
      show a bit of myself along the way.
