<p>
  As much as I would like to claim that the picture on the left is of me, I
  cannot. This is my dog Rilee, and she helps to keep me somewhat sane during
  pretty much anything.
</p>

<p>
  There's not much to say about me other than what can be found around, on my
  <a href="/blog">Blog</a>,
  <a href="https://www.github.com/pyxxil">GitHub</a>/
  <a href="https://www.gitlab.com/pyxxil">Gitlab</a>, or
  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pyxxil">LinkedIn</a>. I'm
  just someone who enjoys solving problems, and programming just so happens to
  be the tool with which I do so.
</p>

<p>
  Generally, I haven't stuck to one singular passion within programming.
  I'll often swap around what I like to do, which may have lead me down to
  almost being a "Jack of All Trades, Master of None", however I like to think
  most of the stuff I have done has all lead to making me a better developer
  in some way. I've spent the past few years working on several personal
  projects, a few of which you can find amongst my
  <a href="/projects">Projects</a> page on this website.

<h2>Experience</h2>
<p>
  I'm currently employed as Junior Fullstack Developer, working with Blockchain related tech, in an agile company.
  Our tech stack involves:
  <ul>
    <li class="about-item">TypeScript/JavaScript (Frontend)</li>
    <li class="about-item">React (Frontend)</li>
    <li class="about-item">Rust (Backend)</li>
    <li class="about-item">Azure (and other DevOps/SRE related activities)</li>
    <li class="about-item">Bash/ZSH/Fish</li>
    <li class="about-item">git</li>
    <li class="about-item">Blockchain</li>
  </ul>

  However I've also worked with, among other things, the following:
  <ul>
    <li class="about-item">Java</li>
    <li class="about-item">Groovy</li>
    <li class="about-item">Python</li>
    <li class="about-item">Angular</li>
    <li class="about-item">AWS</li>
    <li class="about-item">BonitaSoft (Business Process Management)</li>
    <li class="about-item">UiPath (Robotic Process Automation)</li>
    <li class="about-item">C-ish style C++ (OOP was involved)</li>
    <li class="about-item">SQL (MSSql, MySQL, SQLite)</li>
  </ul>

  This has involved me doing Robotic Process Automation, Business Process Management, and optimisation of a two decade old C++ codebase. Perhaps I should just provide a link to my resume here &hellip;
</p>

<p>
  In my own time, with the aforementioned projects, I've built up some skill with
  the following technologies:
  <ul>
    <li class="about-item">C</li>
    <li class="about-item">C++</li>
    <li class="about-item">C#</li>
    <li class="about-item">Debugging (gdb, lldb, rubber duck, print)</li>
    <li class="about-item">HTML/CSS</li>
    <li class="about-item">JavaScript/TypeScript</li>
    <li class="about-item">Linux</li>
    <li class="about-item">React</li>
    <li class="about-item">Rust</li>
    <li class="about-item">Valgrind</li>
    <li class="about-item">And so much more &hellip;</li>
  </ul>
</p>
