<div style="min-width: 320px">
  <h2 class="content-title">Hi, my name is Josh (aka Pyxxil)</h2>

  <h2 class="content-title">Welcome to my website!</h2>

  <p>
    This website exists for several reasons, all of which I will lay out below.
    I hope you enjoy your stay!
  </p>

  <h3 class="centered">To learn about Web Development</h3>

  <p>
    While web development has never been my forte, nor something I'm
    particularly interested in doing, it has its purpose. While this website
    offers me many opportunities that I find a lot more pressing, it would be a
    mistake to not actually enjoy the process, nor actually try my best to
    actually do it well.
  </p>

  <h3 class="centered">To host some of my projects</h3>

  <p>
    This has become a lot more relevant to me now that I've spent a lot of time
    writing Typescript, and dabbling a little with Web Assembly (via Rust and
    wasm-bindgen).
  </p>

  <h3 class="centered">A place I could put some writings</h3>

  <p>
    This might not be as important to anyone else as it is to me, but writing
    has always been my way of getting things off my mind and helping me explain
    things I've been thinking about.
  </p>

  <h3 class="centered">To show off</h3>

  <p>
    One of the more semi-important reasons for making this website. I'm affored
    the opportunity to present a lot of my projects in a nicer way than with a
    GitHub/GitLab repository. That is to say that it allows me to provide my own
    flair and touch to the way they are presented, and hopefully show a bit of
    myself along the way.
  </p>
