  <p>
    I often have a few projects being worked on at any one time, and several of
    them are web-based. This website has allowed me to host many of these rather
    simply, and you can find several of these below.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some of the projects below are not web based, but you'll still find them
    below. If you want to see what I am working on, click on either the
    GitHub/Gitlab links in the header above, or any of the links below.

{% for project in projects %}
<div>
  <a href="{{ project.link }}">
    <h3>{{ project.title }}</h3>
  </a>
  {{ project.description | safe }}
</div>
{% endfor %} {% endblock %}
